            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <img src="" alt="" class="content-image">
            <p>Students face significant challenges when seeking educational loans. They often find it difficult to access financial aid due to eligibility constraints and a lack of clear information about available resources. Many students also struggle with financial concepts, making it hard to understand loan terms and interest rates. This lack of clarity can lead to uninformed borrowing decisions.
               <br> <br> üëâüèª <b>the loan application process is often intricate, involving various documents and criteria, which poses a challenge for some students.</b>
                <br> üëâüèª <b>After graduation, high student loan debt becomes a substantial burden, particularly when managing multiple loans with varying terms.</b>
                <br> üëâüèª <b>The absence of adequate support systems, including a lack of access to financial advisors, compounds these challenges.</b>
                <br><br>Furthermore, economic factors such as a challenging job market or unexpected personal circumstances can further impact a student's ability to repay loans. These pain points highlight the need for user-friendly solutions to simplify the student loan experience.</p>

            <h2>Design phase</h2>
            <img src="" alt="" class="content-image">
            <p>The design process typically involves several stages, including research, ideation, prototyping, and user testing. The first stage involves gathering information about the project's goals, target audience, and any constraints. This information informs the next stage, ideation, where the designer generates a wide range of potential solutions. The designer then selects the most promising ideas and moves into the prototyping stage, where they create low-fidelity versions of the design to test with users. Based on user feedback, the designer iterates on the design until it meets the project's goals and user needs. Finally, the designer refines the design and prepares it for implementation.</p>

            <img src="" alt="" class="content-image">
            <p>Some designs lack engagement and are generic, basic, and unappealing in some cases. They are not user-centric and tend to be bureaucratic. They are more focused on other financial services and have a limited design focus. As a result, they do not fully convey the website's purpose.</p>

            <p>Based on the results of our user research and open moderated card sorting, we have developed the site map. The site map is designed to effectively balance the needs of the business and the users, ensuring a seamless user experience.
                The site map serves as a visual representation of the website's structure and navigation. It outlines the hierarchy of pages and provides a clear overview of how different sections and content are organized. This helps users easily locate the information they need and navigate through the website with ease.
                In developing the site map, we considered the insights and feedback gathered from our user research. We took into account the users' preferences, expectations, and pain points to create a logical and intuitive navigation flow. This ensures that users can find what they are looking for quickly and efficiently.
