            <p>I have gone through over 100 pieces of feedback from users of various POD competitors' websites and analyzed them thoroughly.

            <p>By conducting 10 remote user interviews, I was able to gather a wealth of information about the needs and wants of POD users. During these interviews, I asked open-ended questions and actively listened to the responses in order to gain a deep understanding of their preferences and pain points. I also took careful note of any common themes or patterns that emerged during the interviews.
            <br>As a result of these interviews, I have gained valuable insights into the specific challenges that POD users face and the features that they are looking for in a product. For example, many users expressed a desire for greater flexibility and customization options, while others highlighted the importance of ease of use and intuitive design.
            <br>Overall, this experience has given me a comprehensive understanding of the needs of POD users, which will be instrumental in guiding the development of a truly user-centric product.</p>

            <img src="" alt="" class="content-image">
            <p>When users embark on the journey of designing a custom product on a print-on-demand website, they encounter key touchpoints that shape their experience.
                One critical touchpoint is the design interface itself. Users often face the pain point of complexity when navigating design tools and options. These tools should be intuitive and user-friendly, but when they become cumbersome or confusing, they hinder the creative process and lead to frustration.
                The design interface must seamlessly guide users through the customization process, offering clarity and ease at every step.
                Addressing this pain point and ensuring a smooth design experience is essential to delivering a user journey that fosters creativity and satisfaction.</p>

            <p>During our design process, we did a few usability tests to ensure the content and structure of the our designs addressed the needs of potential users and built the trust we wanted to create with them.
            <br>The purpose of these tests were to answer such questions:   
            <br>Can users easily navigate the platform to create and purchase custom products or sell their designs, promoting a seamless self-shopping and money-making experience?
            <br>Is there accessible information available to guide users on how to effectively utilize the Printum process for selling customized products?

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Usability testing showed beginner users do not distinguish that they can sell customized products and make money through this Printum at first glance.</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>1. Changed the hero image.
                <br>2. Used a clearer slogan for Hero.
                <br>3. Improved the CTA (Sell Online, Buy for yourself, contact us)
                <br>Designed a "Sell Online" button for users who wish to customize a product and sell it to others.
                <br>Designed a "Buy for Yourself" button for users who want to personalize a product and place an order for their use.
                <br>We enhanced the "Contact Us" button, transforming it into a more user-friendly "Help" button. This change provides users with accessible information on how to start the design process, details about production and shipping timelines, shipping costs, and other valuable insights.</p>

                <br><b>Sellers:</b> Users looking to create and sell products through the platform, generating income, must complete the registration process. After registering, they can access their dashboard and begin the product design journey.
                <br>If a user clicks on Buy for yourself button navigate to products page while, If the user clicks on Sell online, navigate to registration page.</p>

            <h2>Lesson learned</h2>
            <p>When designers create websites, apps, or products, they don't just do it once and consider it finished. Instead, they keep making improvements and changes over time based on feedback and testing. Here are some key lessons I learned:
                <br><b>1. UX designers:</b> shouldn't know solutions to all problems. They should know how to use their assets like user testing to find solutions.
                <br><b>2. User-Centric Focus:</b> Placing users at the core of design through research and usability testing elevates the overall experience.
                <br><b>3. Iterative Design:</b> Constant refinement, as seen in usability tests and high-fidelity prototype iterations, leads to better designs.
                <br><b>4. Empathy and Inclusivity:</b> Understanding diverse user needs and incorporating accessibility and inclusive design principles opens doors to broader user satisfaction.
                <br>Through collaboration with cross-functional teams, including developers and product managers, I've refined my ability to communicate effectively. This positions me for future projects with a strong foundation, poised to deliver user-centered, impactful designs.</p>
